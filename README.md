'CodeBook.md' a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data

'run_analysis.R' contains all 5 steps, which were described in Peer-graded Assignment:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
